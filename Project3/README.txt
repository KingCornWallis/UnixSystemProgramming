// This repository contains project 3 for CS 375 for Fall 2018.

The purpose of this project is to create a game using the graphics Curses library as well
as the GDBM library.

I have chosen Sudoku.

There is a problem with the generator currently, and I am working to fix it.

This project is implemented through C++ with some C conventions.
