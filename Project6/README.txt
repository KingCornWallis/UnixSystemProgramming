// This repository contains project 6 for CS 375 for Fall 2018.

The purpose of the project is to employ modern network-based programming techniques to create a simple client-server that works both locally and remotely.

The program consists of two parts, a client and a server: the client, shout.cpp, provides an input file with text inside. The server, shoutd.cpp, extracts the text, capitalizes it, and sends it back to the client in a separate output file.

This project is implemented through C++ with some C conventions.
