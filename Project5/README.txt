// This repository contains project 5 for CS 375 for Fall 2018.

The purpose of this project is demonstrate understanding of how to use signals and POSIX IPC methods to communicate between different programs.

This program has three pieces: the first sends a string to the second, the second reverses the string, and the third capitalizes the strings and sends it back to the first.

All the while, employing various synchronization techniques.

This project is implemented through C++ with some C conventions.
