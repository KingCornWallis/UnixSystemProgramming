// This repository contains the final project for CS 375 for Fall 2018.

This purpose of this project to create a simple network game with a GUI utilizes the GTK+ toolkit.

The project plays the game of rock, paper, scissors across multiple local or remote terminal windows.

It is very buggy; GUI is not available.

This project is implemented through C++ with some C conventions.
